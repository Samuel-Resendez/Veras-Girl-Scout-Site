									<h3>Sponsorships</h3>
									<p>Project Restoration was made possible by two organizations, Redwood Barn Nursery and the Davis Ace Hardware store. Redwood Barn Nurseryʼs Don Shor made several generous tree donations towards my project. Davis Ace Hardwareʼs Store Manager Donn Porter donated stakes, ties, and even a tree. Without the generosity of these two companies and men, this project would not have been possible.</p>

									<p>In addition, I would like to thank my two advisors, Edie Hannigan and Kathy Gill. Edie is quite familiar with the Girl Scouts organization and the Gold Award process, and she was endlessly helpful throughout the entire process. Kathy was my elementary school science teacher at Willett, and she helped lead the planting day and the physical planting of the trees themselves. Without these two women, the project would not have been possible either.</p>

									<p>I would also like to thank the volunteers who volunteered to plant the trees. This included (but is not limited to) Maddie Tomasello, Taylor Robben, Alli Bobrowsky, Adrian Sanchez, and my parents.<p>

									<p>Finally, I would like to thank my brother Samuel Resendez. As a computer scientist at the University of Southern California, Sam helped me create this website.<p>
